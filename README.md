# Rex Herndon - M.S. CISBA Portfolio

Hello! 

My name is Rex Herndon, and I am a student (and soon-to-be graduate) in the M.S. Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics program! I am a proficient back-end web developer due to my courses in Python and Django, and I am in the process of learning more about front-end development through tools like React JS and Angular. I hope to pursue a career in full-stack development, cloud computing, or data analysis once I earn my degree! In my spare time, I am also a musician and I enjoy rock climbing!

This portfolio was created as a prerequisite for the completion of the M.S. CISBA capstone course (CIDM-6395), and it showcases the prototype of a project that I have developed in the course. The project is meant to showcase my understanding of each of the four main knowledge areas in the curriculum - Software Systems (SS), Business Analytics (BA), Data Management (DM), and Cybersecurity and Networking (CN) through their integration and synthesis with my project.

Each knowledge area folder contains a README file explaining the contents of the folder and contents showcasing my final integration and synthesis of that knowledge area with regard to my project.

There is also a folder containing the actual project contents with a README explaining more about the project and an “Additional deliverables” folder containing my final report for the project, a video presentation, and the presentation slides for the project.

- The official repository that I have been using for this project (including a full list of commits to this repository) can be found here: [https://github.com/rexherndon/chordity](https://github.com/rexherndon/chordity)

Thank you for taking the time to look at this, I hope you enjoy it!
