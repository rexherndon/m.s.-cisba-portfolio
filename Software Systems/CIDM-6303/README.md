# Disclaimer:

These samples of different assignments were originally created for my “Technical Foundations in Computer Information Systems” class (CIDM-6303) taught by Dr. Sean Humpherys at West Texas A&M University in the 2022 Fall semester. Since then, these assignments have been published to this GitHub repository as a part of developing my portfolio for my M.S. Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics Capstone Course (CIDM-6395), which is also taught by Dr. Jeffry Babb.
