### This website is no longer under development, and is currently offline and being archived here as my final project for CIDM-6325: E-Commerce and Web Development (taught by Dr. Jeffrey Babb).

**This website is going to be built and set up the following techniques and tools:**

- Django 4.0 and Python 3.11.0
- HTML for front-end interactivity
- Bootstrap for CSS UX Styling
- Heroku (PaaS and Cloud Deployment)
- Sendgrid API

*(Note: For HTML and CSS resources, I plan to look towards the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) and W3Schools for both [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php))*

Since guac-n-roll.net is already taken by my WordPress blog from the first assignment in the semester, I plan to use guac-n-roll.xyz or another related domain (since that has not been purchased yet).

**In this application, I am anticipating that user's will be able to:**

- Navigate to the assigned URL (not officially assigned yet) or search for our website and display our home page.
- View a full directory of our posts in the blog and sort/filter by different properties of a post (e.g - date published, genre, etc.) or search directly for an article
- View the featured article directly on the home page of the website
- Create an account and log in with user authentication
- Create, Update or Delete blog posts through the a sub-URL (e.g - https://guac-n-roll.xyz/create).
- Perform CRUD operations on the admin console (e.g - https://guac-n-roll.xyz/admin) after a superuser is authenticated to manage all posts in the blog.
- Perform password resets on ALL accounts (Sendgrid)

Guac-N-Roll is a homage to other music review blogs, such as [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/) and, more recently, [Lyrical Lemonade](https://lyricallemonade.com/). With my background as a musician (feel free to check out some of my work [here](https://open.spotify.com/artist/21AhXLoNt0k2MFZM7yQWXn?si=2OWkphxbROKbb2Wl7Xn6FQ) as well!), I knew that this would be a great opportunity for me to share my perspective on other artist's music. It's always exciting when I get to hear something fresh from a new artist, or something new from someone I enjoyed listening to in the past. I want to be able to share my thoughts with you, and I hope you can find some great music out of it!
