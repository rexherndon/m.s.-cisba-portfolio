# Software Systems Overview

In the Software Systems curriculum area, I have taken two courses:

- CIDM 6303 - Technical Foundations in Computer Information Systems
- CIDM 6325 - Electronic Commerce and Web Development

During that time, I produced different artifacts of work showcasing the knowledge and skills developed in this curriculum area. These artifacts can be found in two different repositories, but I have also taken the time to copy the contents from those repositories into sub-folders within this repository as well (to keep everything consolidated).

- [https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6303](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6303)
- [https://github.com/rexherndon/guac-n-roll](https://github.com/rexherndon/guac-n-roll)

The folder for CIDM-6303 is mainly a collection of the Python assignments I have done in that course, ranging in varying degrees of complexity. It goes through essential and foundation topics for beginners who are new to Python and coding in general.

“Guac n’ Roll” was the application we created as our final project in CIDM-6325, and is one of my first experiences working with Django. It is a music review blog (similar to Rolling Stone). Alongside that, this application was also created with HTML, CSS (more specifically, Bootstrap), Heroku for cloud hosting (but at this time, I have stopped paying for this service), and the SendGrid API for password resets and email confirmations.

With regard to the project, most of my efforts with development have fallen within the Software Systems curriculum area because the general nature of the project is focused on developing a web application with the tools I have learned from these classes (in addition to some others).

We focused more specifically on building web applications using Django (a popular Python framework focused on back-end web development). We also used other languages and tools, like HTML/CSS/JS for front-end markup, Git and GitHub for version control management, APIs like SendGrid for sending emails to users, and SQL for database management. 

For the most part, these are the tools I used in my project, but in addition to these, I also connected an AWS S3 bucket for static file storage, upgraded the database from the default MySQL configuration to a more robust PostgreSQL database, and deployed my application through a cloud-hosted provider (Render, similar to Heroku or Vercel, which I have used in the past). Throughout the development of this project, to contribute further implementation of the foundational qualities of the Software Systems knowledge area, I also tried to focus on a modular design that could allow for ease of access with new features or implementations in the future.
