# Data Management Written Appraisal

***Rex A. Herndon***

*M.S. - Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics (May 2024)*

*West Texas A&M University*

This written appraisal is meant to be a reflection of the knowledge and skills that I have developed within the “Data Mining and Management” curriculum areas of the Master of Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (MS CISBA) degree, which I will officially earn in May 2024 after my completion of the MS CISBA Capstone Course.

The skills and knowledge I have developed here were based on the following classes I have taken within the Data Management knowledge areas of the curriculum:

- Business Data Extraction, Transformation, and Load (CIDM 6351)
- Data Mining Methods (CIDM 6355)

The remaining sections of the appraisal will be broken down into the following sections:

- Summary Statement
- Overview of Classes
- My Strengths
- My Weaknesses
- Samples of Work
- Future Developments

## Summary Statement

With my knowledge from the Data Management knowledge areas of the MS CISBA curriculum, I have been proven to be capable of understanding different ways to process and understand data, essential topics/aspects in the realms of data mining and data management, and the technical tools used within this scope.

---

## Overview of Classes

Both of the classes that I have taken in the curriculum have shared topics that they teach, such as the general process of collecting and analyzing data and the different ways it can be found, processed, or analyzed.

In the “Business Data Extraction, Transformation, and Load” (CIDM 6351) class, we went through the entire process of acquiring unprocessed data from different sources, such as CSV files, web scraping, JSON files, SQLite databases, etc., cleaning and processing the data to fit our needs, and then using that data for visualization or analysis. This was mainly done through Python and python packages like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib inside of a Jupyter Notebook.

In the “Data Mining Methods” (CIDM 6355) class, we learned about the general process of data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, but we also focused on some of the most common data mining methods, when/where to use each them, how to compare between models, and how to use them in R/RStudio or in RapidMiner. Some of these data mining methods included decision trees, naive bayes classification, logistic regression, and neural network models.

## My Strengths

Regarding my strengths, I found myself feeling the most comfortable with the theory of the process of data ETL and how all of the different parts of acquiring, transforming, and loading data for visualization or further understanding fit together. I feel like once you understand the general process, it builds a road map where all of the specific tools and techniques you learn for data mining and data ETL fit in depending on the context of the business problem. 

---

## My Weaknesses

Within the Data Management curriculum, I noticed that there were times that I was struggling with some of the technical parts of the tools or models I was working with for data mining and analysis. As an example, when we learned about web scraping in Business ETL, I found myself not understanding how parts of the BeautifulSoup package worked when we would scrape from a particular set to get the correct information. Another instance would be when we were first working with Matplotlib and I was unfamiliar with how to use it for certain graphs with my data. Thankfully, there’s plenty of resources and documentation to help navigate around obstacles like this.

## Samples of Work

Samples of my work from both of these classes can be found at the following repos:

[https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6351-artifact](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6351-artifact)

[https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6355-artifact](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6355-artifact)

The CIDM-6341 artifact is my final project going through the entirety of the business ETL process for a set of data, and answering related questions along the process, and the CIDM-6355 artifact is a research report done by myself along with some other students in the class. The report breaks down our findings on the most efficient data mining methods for building a spam filter for email based off of a dataset with spam and legitimate emails.

## Future Developments

In the future, I hope to become more proficient with the tools and techniques used in both of the classes I previously spoke about. A lot of companies depend on machine learning and data mining to develop a competitive edge through areas like artificial intelligence and decision management. I hope I can be able to help these companies with their development or even start my own company and utilize what data I can to have that competitive advantage.

I believe the experience I have developed, recapped through this written appraisal, is enough for me to contribute substantially to my portfolio and the work that I will create for my MS capstone project.
