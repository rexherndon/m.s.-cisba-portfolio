# Business Analytics Written Appraisal

***Rex A. Herndon***

*M.S. - Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics (May 2024)*

*West Texas A&M University*

This written appraisal is meant to be a reflection of the knowledge and skills that I have developed within the “Business Analytics” curriculum areas of the Master of Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (MS CISBA) degree, which I will officially earn in May 2024 after my completion of the MS CISBA Capstone Course.

The skills and knowledge I have developed here were based on the following classes I have taken within the Network and Cybersecurity knowledge areas of the curriculum:

- Seminar in Data Analytics (CIDM 6308)
- Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems (CIDM 5310)

The remaining sections of the appraisal will be broken down into the following sections:

- Summary Statement
- Overview of Classes
- My Strengths
- My Weaknesses
- Samples of Work
- Future Developments

## Summary Statement

With my knowledge from the Business Analytics knowledge areas of the MS CISBA curriculum, I have been proven to be capable of understanding different ways to process and understand data, essential topics/aspects in the realms of data analytics, and the technical tools used within this scope.

---

## Overview of Classes

Both of the classes that I have taken in the curriculum have shared topics that they teach, such as the general process of collecting and analyzing data and the different ways it can be found, processed, or analyzed.

In the “Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems” (CIDM 6351) class, we focused a lot on using the Pandas package in Python for data analysis, and how to do data ETL with Pandas inside of a Jupyter Notebook. We also spent some time with web development, specifically with the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), but our final project was more closely related to the data science portion of the class over the web development portion.

In the “Seminar in Data Analytics” (CIDM 6355) class, we learned about the general process of data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, but we also focused on some of the most common data mining methods, when/where to use each them, how to compare between models, and how to use them in R/RStudio or in RapidMiner (and data visualization with Tableau). Some of these data mining methods included decision trees, naive bayes classification, logistic regression, and neural network models.

## My Strengths

Regarding my strengths, I found myself feeling the most comfortable with the theory and the general process of data analysis and how all of the different parts of acquiring, transforming, and loading data for visualization or further understanding fit together. Between this portion of the curriculum and the data management portion of the curriculum, it helped me understand a lot of the higher level topics of data analysis. I feel like once you understand the general process, it builds a road map where all of the specific tools and techniques you learn for data mining and data ETL fit in depending on the context of the business problem. 

---

## My Weaknesses

Within the Data Management curriculum, I noticed that there were times that I was struggling with some of the technical parts of the tools or models I was working with for data mining and analysis, such as some parts of Pandas or the LAMP stack for the BIDSS class or Tableau for the DA class. Thankfully, there’s plenty of resources and documentation to help navigate around obstacles like this.

---

## Samples of Work

Samples of my work from both of these classes can be found at the following repo’s:

[https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6308-artifact](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6308-artifact)

[https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-5310](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-5310)

The CIDM-6308 artifact is a portion of the final exam we took for that class, and the CIDM-5310 artifact is another part of the final exam for that class. That repo does have files that describe only parts 1 and 3 of the project, but part 2 is actually irrelevant to understand the context of the other parts in the repo.

## Future Developments

In the future, I hope to become more proficient with the tools and techniques used in both of the classes I previously spoke about. A lot of companies depend on machine learning and data mining to develop a competitive edge through areas like artificial intelligence and decision management. I hope I can be able to help these companies with their development or even start my own company and utilize what data I can to have that competitive advantage.

I believe the experience I have developed, recapped through this written appraisal, is enough for me to contribute substantially to my portfolio and the work that I will create for my MS capstone project.
