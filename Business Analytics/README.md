# Business Analytics Overview

This folder contains my written appraisal for the Business Analytics curriculum area in the Master of Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (MS CISBA) degree program. It goes through the classes I have taken within the curriculum, what they have taught me, the strengths and weaknesses I have regarding this knowledge area, samples of the work I have done within these classes, and any future developments I wish to make related to this knowledge area.

In the Business Analytics curriculum area, I have taken two courses:

- CIDM 6308 - Seminar in Data Analytics
- CIDM 5310 - Business Intelligence and Decision Support Systems

During that time, I produced different artifacts of work showcasing the knowledge and skills developed in this curriculum area. These artifacts can be found in three different repositories, but I have also taken the time to copy the contents from those repositories into sub-folders within this repository as well (to keep everything consolidated).

- [https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-5310](https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-5310)

The CIDM-6308 artifact is a portion of training data used for generating different data mining models and statistics needed to complete the final exam.

The CIDM-5310 repository explored and analyzed two datasets that were taken from NYC Open Data. These data frames are records of each motor vehicle collision recorded by NYPD between March 2016 and December 2021, with some outlier records even going as far back as 2012. The pre-processing, analysis, and visualization were all done using Python.

To substantiate my efforts in synthesizing the Business Analytics knowledge area in Chordity, I needed to find ways to gather user data on the web application so they could be processed, visualized, and analyzed. I first did this by creating an anonymous user feedback form and registering it with the back end of my application so it can be accessed and viewed. I was also able to integrate and access the metrics and trackers that Render provides on their hosting services as well, such as the time spent on each page of the platform, when users are on and off of the website, and what times they are accessing it. I have also created an API on my platform using the Django REST framework for fetching basic information about chat rooms as well. With these three methods of collecting data in place, once the platform can acquire a substantial amount of data, it can be further processed and analyzed to draw conclusions about how users are using the platform and how Chordity can be improved upon.
