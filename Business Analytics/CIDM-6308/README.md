# Disclaimer:

These samples of different assignments were originally created for my “Seminar in Data Analytics” class (CIDM-6308) taught by Dr. Liang (Leon) Chen at West Texas A&M University in the 2023 Summer II semester. Since then, these assignments has been published to this GitHub repository as a part of developing my portfolio for my M.S. Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics Capstone Course (CIDM-6395), which is also taught by Dr. Jeffry Babb. 

More information on my knowledge and skills regarding Data Science and Data Analysis can be found on my CIDM-6355 artifact repo, since these two classes have lots of material that overlap between each other. (https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6355-artifact)
