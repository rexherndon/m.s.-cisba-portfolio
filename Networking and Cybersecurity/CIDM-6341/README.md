This assignment was originally intended as the final project for my “Current Issues in Cybersecurity” class (CIDM-6341) taught by Dr. Murray Jennex at West Texas A&M University in the Spring 2023 semester. Since then, this assignment has been published to this GitHub repository as a part of developing my portfolio for my M.S. Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics Capstone Course (CIDM-6395) taught by Dr. Jeffry Babb. 

The business (along with other individuals/entities that may have been reviewed in this audit) have no identifiable information listed here in order to protect their privacy and right to confidentiality.
