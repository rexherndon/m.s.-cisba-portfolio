# Evolution 1: Networking and Security Written Appraisal

# Networking and Security Written Appraisal

***Rex A. Herndon***

*M.S. - Computer Information Systems & Business Analytics (May 2024)*

*West Texas A&M University*

This written appraisal is meant to be a reflection of the knowledge and skills that I have developed within the Network and Cybersecurity curriculum areas of the Master of Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics (MS CISBA) degree, which I will officially earn in May 2024 after my completion of the MS CISBA Capstone Course.

The skills and knowledge I have developed here were based on the following classes I have taken within the Network and Cybersecurity knowledge areas of the curriculum:

- Current Issues in Cybersecurity (CIDM 6341 - Spring 2023)
- Networking Management and Information Security (CIDM 6340 - Summer 2023)

The remaining sections of the appraisal will be broken down into the following sections:

- Summary Statement
- Overview of Classes
- My Strengths
- My Weaknesses
- Samples of Work
- Future Developments

## Summary Statement

With my knowledge from the Networking and Security knowledge areas of the MS CISBA curriculum, I have been proven to be capable of understanding different cybersecurity frameworks/policies (such as NIST and ISO), essential topics/aspects in the realms of networking and cybersecurity, and the technical tools used within this scope.

## Overview of Classes

Both of the classes that I have taken in the curriculum have shared topics that they teach, such as current/future trends, preventative and preemptive measures to take to secure an organization, basic topics and definitions of networking and security, and how each of them goes hand-in-hand.

In the “Current Issues in Cybersecurity” class (CIDM 6341), we primarily focus on different policies, procedures, and frameworks that an organization or business can use for cybersecurity. We primarily worked with the NIST framework, but also spoke about other important frameworks, such as ISO, GDPR, or PCI DSS. We also spoke about different types of policies, such as mobile security, wireless security, and even physical security.

In the “Networking Management and Information Security” class (CIDM 6340), we mainly focused more on the technical aspects of cybersecurity and hand-on activities to help us understand how to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in an organization’s network. This was tied with the context of a ransomware recovery research paper created by Dr. Jennex, where we were ultimately tasked to prepare a (legitimate or hypothetical) business against a ransomware attack.

## My Strengths

Regarding my strengths, I felt a lot more confident in my ability to work with the technical tools we worked with in the classes. This included tools like John the Ripper (a brute-force password cracker), Prey (an endpoint manager), Refog, (a keylogger), Nmap (a port/device scanner), Wireshark (a network packet sniffer), and other tools. This one might be because I’ve had more exposure to these tools outside of this class, since I currently work in the IT department here at West Texas A&M University.

## My Weaknesses

Some aspects of this curriculum I noticed I was struggling with were related to inventory and policy management. For me, the thought of needing to create a new policy and update/modify it to be more relevant to a particular organization (assuming if you are taking policies from a framework like NIST) can be challenging at times, especially since the world of cybersecurity is constantly evolving. The same could potentially be said for me with inventory management as well. Inventory management and endpoint protection can certainly be a challenge, especially within a large organization with so many devices to protect. It’s a big challenge for people in the field of cybersecurity because an intruder only really needs to find one way in to take advantage of an exploit or steal valuable data, while the defenders of an organization have to take measures to secure every possible way into an organization’s network. It’s a constant battle in the world of cybersecurity, and it’s one that most organizations still work on on a day-to-day basis.

## Samples of Work

Samples of my work from both of these classes can be found at the following repo’s:

https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6340-artifact

https://github.com/rexherndon/cidm-6341-artifact

The CIDM-6341 artifact is a report that goes through a cybersecurity audit I did on a local coffee shop in Amarillo, Texas, and the CIDM-6340 artifact goes through a similar audit/report to prepare another small business for a ransomware attack.

## Future Developments

In the future, I wish to be more proactive and embrace newer technologies and techniques in the realm of cybersecurity. As stated in the previous sections, cybersecurity is an ongoing battle and it’s important to be aware and open to change as new developments come along. I also wish that I was more cognizant of the bigger picture of an organization and I wish I had more insight into how all departments within IT come together to defend an organization from threats to their network, since the concept of IT can have such a broad range of jobs, from networking, to the help desk, to DevSecOps, to the data scientists/engineers, etc. Being able to understand the bigger picture and how all of the moving pieces move to work together is just as important as understanding the technical components of one particular job or tool.

I believe the experience I have developed, recapped through this written appraisal, is enough for me to contribute substantially to my portfolio and the work that I will create for my MS capstone project.
